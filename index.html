    <h1>ABOUT THE EXOPLANET</h1>
    
    <img src="images/zephryon1.jpg"  style="float: right;">
    
    <p>Zephryon is located approximately 150 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquilonis. It orbits the G-type star "Solara," which is similar in size and characteristics to our own sun.<br><br>Zephryon is a terrestrial exoplanet with a diameter about 1.5 times that of Earth.</p>
</section>   
        
<!-----------GEOGRAPHY------------>
        
<section id="geography" class="geography">
        <h1>GEOGRAPHY</h1>
        <img src="images/zephryon3.jpg" style="float: right">
        <p>The planet has a diverse climate due to its axial tilt, resulting in varied ecosystems and weather patterns. Zephryon has a breathable atmosphere with a composition similar to Earth, making it potentially habitable for humans. <br><br>The planet boasts vast, lush forests, expansive oceans, and towering mountain ranges. It is known for its breathtaking landscapes and unique geological formations. Zephryon orbits Solara at an average distance of approximately 120 million kilometers, putting it in the star's habitable zone.</p>
</section>
        
    
<!-----------MOONS------------>
    
<section id="moons" class="moons">
    <h1>MOONS</h1>
    <h2>Lunaris</h2>
    <img src="images/LUNARIS.jpg" style="float: right">
    <p>Lunaris, the larger of the two moons orbiting planet Zephryon, presents a unique lunar landscape. With a diameter approximately half that of Earth, it graces the Zephryonian night sky with its imposing presence. The moon's surface is marked by cratered terrain, revealing the scars of countless asteroid impacts over its history. These craters are of great interest to scientists studying lunar geology and planetary formation.<br><br>

Lunaris possesses a thin atmosphere primarily composed of trace gases, rendering it inhospitable to humans without life support systems. Its extreme temperature variations, from frigid nights to scorching days, result from the absence of a substantial atmosphere for temperature regulation.<br><br>

Despite these challenges, Lunaris offers captivating natural phenomena, including occasional "lunar lightning storms" that illuminate the night sky in breathtaking displays. It also experiences "moonquakes" caused by gravitational interactions with Zephryon and its companion moon, Stellara.<br><br>

Lunaris serves as a hub for scientific missions and research outposts, drawing researchers from Zephryon and beyond. Tourists, too, are enticed by the moon's natural beauty and lunar eclipses that align it with Zephryon and Solara. Lunar expeditions offer adventurers a chance to explore its cratered surface and witness the wonders of lunar exploration up close. Lunaris stands as a testament to the intrigue and beauty of our celestial neighbors.<br><br></p>
    
    <h2>Stellara</h2>
    <img src="images/STELLARA.jpg" style="float: right">
    <p>Stellara, Zephryon's smaller moon, presents a captivating lunar world with its own unique charm. Roughly one-third the size of Earth, Stellara graces the night sky with an enchanting landscape.<br><br>

Its surface is a picturesque blend of ice-covered plains and rugged, snow-capped mountains, earning it the poetic nickname "The Ice Jewel." Stellara's pristine, frozen beauty is a testament to the celestial artistry of the universe.<br><br>

Though possessing a thin atmosphere primarily composed of trace gases, Stellara's climate is characterized by extreme cold, particularly during its extended nights. Despite its harsh environment, the moon occasionally experiences breathtaking ice storms, where swirling, frozen particles dance in the lunar winds.<br><br>

Stellara holds great scientific appeal, attracting researchers eager to study its unique geological features, which provide valuable insights into lunar science and planetary evolution.<br><br>

For adventurous tourists, guided expeditions offer the chance to explore Stellara's icy terrain, making it a sought-after destination for those seeking otherworldly experiences. In Zephryon's celestial neighborhood, Stellara shines as a captivating lunar gem, adding to the wonder of this fictional planetary system.<br><br></p>
